This is an implementation of a Blackjack exercise for those wishing to learn Clojure.

Below is a brief description of the game from CardPlayer.


Blackjack (also called "21") is a fun and enjoyable casino card game. The basic rules of blackjack are quite easy to learn.

As the name 21 implies, the object of the game is to come as close to 21 points as possible with your cards -- without going over -- and have a higher total than the dealer.  The suits of the cards have no significance.

The game begins with the player receiving two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards.

The player wins if the total value of the player's cards is closer to 21 than the dealer's cards. Another way to win is if the dealer goes over 21, while the player does not.  However, the player loses if that total goes over 21.

Cards 2 through 10 have face value (for instance, 2 of hearts is worth 2 points and 10 of clubs is worth 10 points).

Jacks, queens and kings are each valued at 10 points.

Aces are valued at either 11 or 1, depending on which is more advantageous to the player. 

This exercise is to introduce key conecepts from Clojure such as maps and cond.
